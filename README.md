JASPEX model was developed using high-level programming languages. 
It was extensively and rigorously programmed over many years by [Dr.Olugbenga Oluwagbemi].
The accompany data were processed and reformatted into its current form using Python programming within Jupyter Notebook enivironment and Shell programming.

We wrote new sets of python codes and developed python programming codes to rework on the map to generate 
the coloured map of Southwest Nigeria from the map of Nigeria (which represented the region of our study).
This GitHub project data also contains processed weather collection data for the region of study from year 2006 to year 2019.
This repository also contains codes used for processing the data and formatting the data into an appropriate and suitable format for the JASPEX model to effectively absorb and process.
