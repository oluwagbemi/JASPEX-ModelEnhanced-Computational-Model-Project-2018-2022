We wrote new sets of python codes and developed python programming codes to rework on the map to generate 
the map of Southwest Nigeria from the map of Nigeria(which represented the region of our study).
This GitHub project data also contains the weather collection data for the region of study from year 2006 to year 2019.
This repository also contains codes used for processing the data and formatting the data into an appropriate format 
for the JASPEX model to effectively absorb and process.

JASPEX model was developed using Java programming language and Visual C++/C++ programming language. 
It was extensively and rigorously programmed over many years. [Dr.Olugbenga Oluwagbemi]
